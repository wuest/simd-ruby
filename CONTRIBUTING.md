## How to contribute to SIMD-Ruby

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please reference [SECURITY.md][1-security:0] for specific instructions.
In short, please email a maintainer, using encrypting your message with the
maintainer's PGP key if possible.

#### **Did you find a problem?**

Whether the problem is related to code, documentation or other issues with
SIMD-Ruby, please refer to this checklist.

* **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub
  issues.**  Please refer to [SECURITY.md][1-security:0] for specific reporting
  instructions.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
  [Issues][2-bugs:0-issues].

* If no outstanding issue exists, please
  [open a new issue][2-bugs:1-new-issue]. If possible, please include a
  **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the problem
  you've encountered.

#### **Did you write a patch which fixes a bug or adds a feature?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution, and
  include the relevant issue number if one exists.

* Please make sure that the new functionality is covered by tests.  If the patch
  addresses a bug, please make sure to add the inputs known to trigger the bug
  in a test to prevent regressions.

* Before submitting, please familiarize yourself with the
  [Contributor Code of Conduct][3-patch:0-code-of-conduct].
