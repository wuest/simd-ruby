= SIMD

SIMD is a library which exposes basic SIMD functionality for more efficient
computation.

== Support

Ruby (MRI) 2.7 and later is supported.

== Using SIMD
=== Creating and Using SIMD Objects

SIMD objects can be created by passing Arrays of compatible objects to their
appropriate constructors (see below, Available Types):

  # Create a SIMD object for Float arithmetic
  simd1 = SIMD::FloatArray.new([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
  simd2 = SIMD::FloatArray.new([2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0])

SIMD objects can be treated as numeric objects once created:

  # Extract the result of multiplication of both sets
  simd3 = simd1 * simd2

Use the +to_a+ method to extract data from SIMD objects:

  simd3.to_a
  # => [2.0, 8.0, 18.0, 32.0]

=== Available Types

Currently the following types are available:

  * double: FloatArray
  * float:  SmallFloatArray
  * int:    IntArray
  * long:   LongArray

=== Comparison

Comparison operators are supported, with behavior not adapted from platform
behavior.  On x86/amd64, the result of a comparison will be -1 if the comparison
succeeds, and 0 otherwise.
